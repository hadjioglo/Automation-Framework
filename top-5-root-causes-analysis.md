# Top 5 Recurring Root Cause Patterns & Prevention Strategies

## 1. State Management Issues (35 bugs - 25% of all bugs)
**Pattern**: UI components losing state, form data not persisting, modal states getting corrupted

**Examples**:
- SKY-295: Mobile search field not showing after close/reopen
- SKY-289: Date selection not saved on edit search
- SKY-282: Wrong selected state after edit tap
- SKY-199: Manual tips not saved after fixed selection
- SKY-263: Date picker remains after menu close

**Root Causes**:
- Improper React/Vue state management
- Missing state cleanup on component unmount
- Race conditions in async state updates
- Local storage not syncing with component state

**Prevention Strategies**:
1. **State Management Standards**:
   - Implement Redux/Vuex for complex state
   - Use state machines (XState) for modal flows
   - Establish clear state ownership patterns

2. **Testing Approaches**:
   - **Integration Tests**: Test complete user flows across components
   - **State Snapshots**: Capture and compare state at each step
   - **Mobile-specific Testing**: Test state persistence across screen rotations, app backgrounding
   - **Cross-browser Testing**: Ensure state consistency across browsers

3. **Development Practices**:
   - Code reviews focusing on state lifecycle
   - Mandatory cleanup functions for event listeners
   - State debugging tools in development

## 2. Input Validation Logic Problems (28 bugs - 20% of all bugs)
**Pattern**: Forms accepting invalid data, business rules not enforced, security vulnerabilities

**Examples**:
- SKY-253: Split payment can exceed total amount
- SKY-264: Same city selection allowed without error
- SKY-216: Negative amounts allowed in split payment
- SKY-288: Trip type change allows search without date selection
- SKY-139: Cabin class can be deleted and search submitted

**Root Causes**:
- Client-side validation only (no server-side validation)
- Inconsistent validation rules across forms
- Missing edge case handling
- Business rule validation gaps

**Prevention Strategies**:
1. **Validation Framework**:
   - Implement schema-based validation (Joi, Yup, Zod)
   - Server-side validation mirrors client-side rules
   - Centralized validation rule definitions

2. **Testing Approaches**:
   - **Boundary Value Testing**: Test min/max values, edge cases
   - **Property-based Testing**: Generate random invalid inputs
   - **Security Testing**: Test for injection attacks, data manipulation
   - **API Contract Testing**: Ensure backend validates all inputs

3. **Development Practices**:
   - Validation-first development approach
   - Automated validation rule documentation
   - Regular security audits of input handling

## 3. Mobile UI/Responsive Design Issues (25 bugs - 18% of all bugs)
**Pattern**: Mobile-specific rendering problems, touch interactions failing, responsive breakpoints broken

**Examples**:
- SKY-294: Unnecessary scroll on mobile request page
- SKY-266: Airport List Table View is half-cut
- SKY-260: Main page visible behind search page (z-index)
- SKY-259: Unwanted zoom-in when clicking to type
- SKY-285: Desktop view accessible on mobile

**Root Causes**:
- Insufficient mobile testing during development
- CSS specificity conflicts on mobile
- Viewport meta tag issues
- Touch event handling problems

**Prevention Strategies**:
1. **Mobile-First Development**:
   - Design and develop mobile experience first
   - Progressive enhancement for desktop
   - Consistent design system with mobile components

2. **Testing Approaches**:
   - **Device Testing**: Real device testing matrix (iOS/Android)
   - **Visual Regression Testing**: Screenshot comparisons across breakpoints
   - **Touch Testing**: Automated touch event simulation
   - **Performance Testing**: Mobile network conditions, battery usage

3. **Development Practices**:
   - Mobile debugging tools in development environment
   - Responsive design code reviews
   - CSS-in-JS for component-scoped styling

## 4. Form Handling & Navigation Issues (20 bugs - 14% of all bugs)
**Pattern**: Form submission failures, tab navigation broken, multi-step form flow problems

**Examples**:
- SKY-102: Can't submit payment despite complete info
- SKY-217: Split payment fields tab navigation broken
- SKY-184: Text fields lose data with tab navigation
- SKY-273: Edit search skips date picker
- SKY-12: Phone number field issues in pay later form

**Root Causes**:
- Poor accessibility implementation
- Form validation blocking submission incorrectly
- Missing form state persistence
- Complex multi-step form logic

**Prevention Strategies**:
1. **Form Architecture**:
   - Multi-step form state machines
   - Progressive form saving (draft functionality)
   - Accessible form patterns by default

2. **Testing Approaches**:
   - **Accessibility Testing**: Screen reader, keyboard navigation testing
   - **Form Flow Testing**: Complete user journey automation
   - **Cross-Platform Testing**: Different browsers, assistive technologies
   - **Load Testing**: Form performance under high traffic

3. **Development Practices**:
   - Form component library with built-in validation
   - A11y linting rules in CI/CD
   - User testing sessions for complex forms

## 5. Email System & Communication Issues (12 bugs - 9% of all bugs)
**Pattern**: Email delivery failures, template formatting problems, content synchronization issues

**Examples**:
- SKY-301, SKY-296: Pack of small bugs for flight request emails
- SKY-210: PQ email time doesn't match checkout flow
- SKY-196: Both Economy/Business quotes show as Business
- SKY-192: Agent doesn't receive PQ email
- SKY-32: Flight request email missing call to action

**Root Causes**:
- Template data binding issues
- Email service configuration problems
- Data transformation bugs between systems
- Missing email delivery monitoring

1. **Email Infrastructure**:
   - Template testing environment
   - Email delivery monitoring and alerting
   - Standardized email template system
   - Data schema validation for email content

2. **Testing Approaches**:
   - **Email Testing Tools**: Litmus, Email on Acid for rendering
   - **Template Unit Tests**: Test data binding and conditional logic
   - **Integration Tests**: End-to-end email delivery verification
   - **A/B Testing**: Email content and delivery optimization

3. **Development Practices**:
   - Email preview functionality in admin panel
   - Centralized email configuration management
   - Email template version control and rollback capability
