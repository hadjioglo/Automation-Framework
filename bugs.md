The file with the value date of 29^th^ has a date/time later than the file with a value date of the 30^th^… and by the time we received the file from 29^th^ we had probably already processed the file for 30^th^ – see this image of when OBN download the files…<br><br><br><br>!image-20241031-070456.png\|width=657,height=249,alt="image-20241031-070456.png"!<br><br><br><br> <br><br>Here is the import and processing records – there is no record that the system even tried to import the file of 29^th^…<br><br><br><br>!image-20241031-070519.png\|width=668,height=196,alt="image-20241031-070519.png"!<br><br><br><br>Thoughts:<br><br># Why did devops not get notified that the payment file was not processed? It had been downloaded, we already had received the money, and the reference and value matched. We can never have the case where a payment file is not processed and we are not notified.<br># Does the OBN platform not process a file for a historic date that is out of sequence, even if it has not been processed? If this is the case, we need to remove that validation.<br><br>___________________________________________________________________________<br><br>David investigation:<br><br><br><br>I don’t believe it will import a file with the same date in the file name which has already been processed due to:<br><br>src/Repository/Payment/BamboraPaymentRepository.php<br><br>findMaxDateGroupByBamboraMid() returning *2024-10-30*;<br><br> <br><br>src/Command/Payment/Bambora/SettlementReport/BamboraImportPaymentsCommand.php<br><br>shouldImportReport() checking if *2024-10-30* (the date in the file name) is different to the maxDate *2024-10-30* which it isn’t so it will return false and not Import the file<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>_______________________________________________________<br><br>Thanks Dave.<br><br>Ramona – if that is the problem, we need to redo that validation, but more urgently we need to get the file processed. I’m not sure if we have a production command that forces processing overriding any validation below that Dave highlighted if that is what stopped it.<br><br>We probably also want some slightly different logic in the processing cronjob that makes the ‘Processed Date’ of the transaction to be set to the later date of ‘Value Date’ or the time the money arrived – and not the date it was actually processed. This will allow us to process files that arrive late, and still settle with the delay they would have had if they had arrived on time. Ie. Tuesday’s file that arrived a day late and was processed on Wednesday, should have the transaction processed date of Tuesday. But this can wait as a follow on change – we need to get the current file processed. |  |  | 128 |  |  | 3 |
