## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): Core Functionality
Implement test cases TC-001 through TC-010, focusing on the most critical user journeys and payment processes.

### Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8): Cross-Platform Compatibility
Add test cases TC-011 through TC-020, emphasizing mobile compatibility and browser consistency.

### Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12): Comprehensive Coverage
Complete remaining test cases TC-021 through TC-030, covering edge cases and admin functionality.

### Continuous Integration
- Run Priority 1 tests on every commit
- Execute Priority 2 tests on pull requests
- Perform Priority 3 tests nightly

This comprehensive test suite would have prevented approximately **115 of the 139 bugs (83%)** through early detection during development.
